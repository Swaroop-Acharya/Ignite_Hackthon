All,

See attached warning from Bankers Life and Casualty Insurance Group. Looks like they are going to stop accepting incomplete
submissions from Honeybee Home Care.

Is there anything we can do to rectify this situation or, is this something Honeybee will reimburse my mother for should the
insurance company not receive the necessary information to process these claims? Seems like just a matter of sending in the
complete and concise documentation.

Note the date on the letter. We need to get completed documentation to them as soon as possible.

Thank you,
