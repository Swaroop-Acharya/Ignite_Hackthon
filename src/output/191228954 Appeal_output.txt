October 17, 2024. 38 28 YC!

To whom it may concern;

Tam hereby requesting a review of the decision not to provide benefits based upon my living in the
home.

My folks likely would have died much sooner had J not been:in the home. I came home 3 times to find
the strong odor of gas in the house, folks passed out on the couch. They were good at turning the’stove
off to: where:the flame was out but the gas was still on. I forced. a change to. an electric-stove.

My mom passed a couple years ago and her policy was forgotten. My dad has inemory, co ignitive issues
and has separation anxiety. He said the other day that he is becoming very absent minded. So even he
knows it.

Even if f prepare meals-for him if I need to be out of the house, he doesn't eat them. If] am not home ta
be sure he eats, he will sat M&Ms, potato chips, ice ream and wash it down with coke:

He has a wound on his leg and extreme-nail fiingus that he didn't say anything about. He could have
lost his foot and part of his leg if it were not discovered.

[have picked him up off the floor at 2:30 in the. morning and out ofa snow bank he fell into at 10:30 in
the morning, His driveway is shortand steep to the point where I can not allow him to be on it at any
time because he loses his balatice arid falls. He took me to the airport years ago and couldn't remember
how to get home. We are 10 minutes at most-from the airport.

My mom had a medical emergency and my dad called me, I was'2 hours away just sitting down for a
meeting. He decided that he would wait to call.911-until I was back home. I finally talked him into:
calling 911. I asked for forgiveness and left the meeting, I drove home as fast as I could, straight to the
ER. He can nat make good decisions and needs 24/7 care. He doesn't need his:hand held every second
but someone needs to be there when he needs help for all these reasons.

[understand the exclusion in the policy. But Iam his best option at. this point and I am your. least
expelisive option as well.

In the event that-you can not over ride this-provision in the policy, I have found a guy with experience
who is willing to be availablé-4 to 5 hours a day and willing to accept-_ payment in the amount of the
policy.

Thave included his paperwork for consideration.
