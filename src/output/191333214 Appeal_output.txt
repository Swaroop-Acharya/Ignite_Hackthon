To Whom It May Concern:

Please consider this my request for appeal of your decision that | am not Chronically ill and
able to complete activities of daily living independently. My physicians have advised you, lam
im fact chronically il and need care, you state that | have not disouted this fact, which is false.
my initial appeal had letters that stated | was chronically ill from two medical professionals.
have Rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and A-fib. While my doctor did not specify exactly what |
needed, she stated | would need help for a lifetime with ADL’s. My Rheumatologist also
advised that | need help with ADLs, | need help every day of the week, according to your
denial you have nothing that says anyone else helps me and because | only have in home help
two days a week, se | must be able to complete ADL’s on my own. My daughter has been or
several of the interviews, and nurse evaluations in which she stated she helps with bathing/hair
washing and incontinance issues, she alen helped me get dressed in the evaluation. lam
unable to properly perform hygiene tasks and have falling twice in last two weeks transferring
onto my couch or my bed, the fire department was called for assistance. In the June 14
evaluation, | did report that | could not do everything and my daughter reported what she did,
in adaition to heiping me dress she had to help me with transition fram my walker and off the
bed. You have not reached out to my daughter or my Rheumatologist. If you felt there was not
enough information from my primary care provider, perhaps they should have been contacted
to clear up how | need a lifetime of support with ADL’s but no specific one checked off. | arn
going to contact legal counsel as | believe your actions are not justified.

Respectiully yours.
