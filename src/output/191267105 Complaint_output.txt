Hi,

Please look at the invoices again. You will see that we are submitting $12,100 on average per month and that you
are rejecting $1,600 on average per month, meaning that you are only paying $10,400 and not her $11,700
monthly maximum.

Please take the time to look again at several months to get a sense of the problem. My mother is a retired school
teacher and can’t afford to lose $15,000 per year.

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Dawn,

Thanks for confirming. But the problem is that her benefits are being capped at $10,400, with notation that she has
reached her full monthly benefit, which is obviously incorrect.

Can you please issue her credit for the past errors and fix this going forward?

Thanks,
Eric

S WARNING: Extemal email, exercise caution!}

Hello,

I am writing on behalf of Janet Greenhut, policy 33-329556, as her POA having paperwork on file with you for the
same,

Upon reviewing her accounts we do not understand the amount of her reimbursements by Mutual of Omaha. To our
understanding, her monthly maximum is approximately $11,750. She is submitting valid claims for homecare of
approximately $12,100 per month.

The review shows that when totaling the payments, she has been receiving approximately $10,400 per month on
average. At the same time, the invoices from MOO state that she has hit her maximum monthly payment, and so
they are not being paid in full.

Can you please confirm the level of her monthly maximum under this policy?
We would appreciate a correction to be made to her past and future payments to address the discrepancy.

Thanks,
Eric Greenhut
