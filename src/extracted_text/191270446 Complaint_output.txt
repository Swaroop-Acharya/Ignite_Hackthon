Dear Katherine,

Thank you for your concern. We can now see on the web portal NYL have accepted the POC status as a green
checkmark. We have now have submitted 24 out of 25 documents. The only remaining item is the Daily Visit Notes
from Fox. Ifthe LTC Representative can examine the Occupational Therapy Notes are DVN which lists all exercises and
assessments from each visit 3x per week. There is no form requested that we know of - it's a letter going directly to

Fox.

Elizabeth has been in touch with Fox they have no further paperwork to provide. The gentleman's name is Andrew
Schaefer +1 347 525 3771 and he has been very accommodating..

Best,
Edward J. Nelowet

: I don’t know what they mean by “Plan of Care” and who provides it.
: It's difficult to know what is going on. I've seen similar situations.

: Evidently, Fox uses a different format. Did NYLrequest specific form?. There is an indicator, but I can’t open it.

: Can you let me know contact information for Fox rehab?
: Til see what I can find out.

: Dear Long Term Care Representative,

: This is becoming increasingly frustrating and has been ongoing for the past 6 weeks. | have called the 800 number on several occasions and
: have now been advised to write to this email.

: New York Life has requested A) Occupational Therapy Notes, B) Plan of Care, and C) Daily Visiting Notes from Fox Rehabilitation to

: determine the claim eligibility. Fox Rehabilitation has provided documents called Occupational Therapy Treatment Encounter reports for

: each visit. The aforementioned Occupational Therapy Treatment Encounter reports contain all of the information which should satisfy New

: York Life's requirements. However, New York Life is only considering the supplied reports as Occupational Therapy Notes and continues to


: request Plan of Care and Daily Visiting Notes.

Please review all provided Occupational Therapy Treatment Encounter reports for required information under the heading "Plan" (POC) and
Activities" (DVN). Fox has no other documentation to provide. We request that the POC and DVN requirements be fulfilled with the supplied
: documentation so the initiated claim eligibility decision can be made promptly. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

: Best,
