RE: Catha Hesse
Claim Numbers: 190993151, 190894706
Policy Number: 076674001

Dear CNA:

The following emails form the head nurse (Lisa Mitchell) at my Mom’s (Catha
Hesse) independent living facility (Newbury Court) documenting 1) my Mom’s
continued decline in mental faculties due to here alzheimers/dementia
condition; 2) recommendation by the facility that my mom start receiving 24/7
care and oversight; and 3) consideration to be transferred to the adjacent
memory unit (“The Gardens”). We had a call with the head nurse, her staff,
and the administrator of the Gardens.

Attached are the emails. Here's a summary of the recommendations,
incidents, and changes noted by staff

1) Per A Zoom Call on October 15: Lisa and the staff noted continued
cognitive decline. The see that my mom has decreased satefy
awareness, as evidenced by the burning hot plate, but also not using her
cane for stability where she is at increased risk of falls (gait stability
issue). They recommended

a.

b.

Medication for her paranoia (see below) so that immediate issues
can be addressed.

Keeping her active during the day but having 24/7 oversight. As a
facility, they don’t have the staff or directive to provide 24/7
oversight. One staff member saw her walking off and was
concerned enough to follow her to make sure she was okay,
seeing her cognitive decline. They said if 24/7 care wasn’t possible
at the moment, they recommended a minimum 11-8 oversight
(due to my mom waking up and getting going late (10-11) and
going to bed early right after 8. They do a wellness check in the
evenings also making sure she takes her medication for sleep.

. that she be considered for transfer to the Gardens (memory care

unit with lockdown). The staff is concerned about her daily walks


out of the facility, her getting lost, and also falling without
accompaniment due to her instability.

2) Paranoia: She has had additional incidents of paranoia (some
previously reported to CNA). The new incidents are ones that the staff
have had to respond to — in addition to other incidents that my mom
reported to my sister including knocking at the door, fear of being
assaulted, and believing that the nursing staff had a code to her room
(last week) to get in. My mom has pulled her safety neckless to alert
staff, in addition to a camera having been installed. No incidents of
anyone trying to break in were evidenced.

3) Safety: There was incident this past week where my Mom tried to cook
chicken directly on a hot plate without a pan. She was confused by what
she did and still doesn’t seem to understand the issue. The building fire
alarms were set off and the entire fire department came. This was
probably the 5" time of events happening in a similar nature. Her stove
had previously been unplugged because she had left the stove on or put
things on top of the stove causing the fire alarms to go off. The hot plate
was provided since it had a safety shut off, but my mom still is
confused. It is likely she will have to go to the facility dining halls for hot
meals.

4) Confusion: The head chapel minister who was on our zoom call noted
that my Mom shows up to church confused why she is there. They have
to direct her and have been giving her “jobs” (like greeting, etc) to make
her feel calm. She has also been writing checks from an inactive
account - and the minister has agreed to simply allow her to write these
but tare them up.

Please consider this information in your approval for eligibility. My mom needs
substantial oversight from pill taking, getting to buses for groceries etc,
cooking, stability issues, safety issues, and activity engagement.

Hi John and Alicia,

The entire team appreciated the time we had with you both today to discuss your mother’s
safety and care needs. We know this is a difficult time for you as a family as you consider
the next transition and we are here to support you through that process.

As we factor in Catha’s memory/cognitive issues and her decreased safety awareness, the
team believes your mother needs increased support and would benefit from a setting like
the Garden’s. Until that can happen, we proposed:

1. 24/7 DALs support but you shared the financial limitations of this. We then


recommended DALS 11 AM- 8 PM Daily with RHS wellness checks (ie: 9:15PM,
2AM, 6AM) which you both agreed made sense but you planned to review this with
each-other this evening and get back to us tomorrow Wed 10/16/24.

2. Medication: | plan to follow up with Denise Klouda SW to see if Dr Squier has
recommendations for Psychiatrist (locally) that could help prescribe the medication
he suggested.

3. Safety tracker: we suggested Life 360 App that can be downloaded on your mother’s
cell phone and can assist you in monitoring your mother’s location, especially given
the team’s concerns of her walking alone on campus or over to Emerson Hospital.
We have advised that your mother have the DALS cg with her for any outside walk.

4. | will follow up with John with a short nursing summary of our observations on
Catha’s cognition over last few months and why she needs the current level of
support so you can submit claim for LTC.

5. The Gardens: John/Alicia you plan to follow with Erin/Karen re: next steps, LTC
coverage, etc

We look forward to hearing from you tomorrow. Thank you for working with us to best
support your mother.

Warmly,

Lisa

Hi Alicia and John,

| wanted to inform you both of an incident that happened with your mother last evening.
She apparently was using a hot plate to cook a piece of chicken and placed the chicken
directly on the surface of the hot plate. It burned and set off the smoke alarm. Our
concierge staff called 911 and Concord fire Department responded, made sure she was
safe and had her leave her suite while they cleared smoke with fans, reset alarm and
ensured suite was safe for her to return. Our RHS aides did check on her again at 8:30pm,
she was fine but did not fully understand how/why the smoke alarm went off. | plan to go
see your mother this morning to make sure the hot plate is removed from her suite. As you
know, her stove was turned off a couple of months ago due to safety concerns and will
remain off.

We would like to have a family Zoom meeting today, if possible, to discuss our safety
concerns and your mother’s memory decline and share our recommendations as we
consider how to best support your mom in a safe environment.

Let us know times you can meet today and | will send a zoom invite (we can’t meet from 1-
2pm).

Kind regards,

Lisa
