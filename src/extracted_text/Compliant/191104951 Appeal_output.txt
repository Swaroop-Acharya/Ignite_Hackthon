Re: Mary C. Flagg
Policy # 077018213

As { sit here at the Library | worry about my mother’s safety. On Saturday | left her to run to the grocery
store. When | returned, she was on the bedroom floor for most of the time | was gone. Sunday
morning, she called my name. | went into the living room and she was straddled on the recliner arm of
the chair, She missed the center of the seat. Seems kind of funny but she.was scared, she had no idea
what went wrong, This | believe is her fifth fall since March 2024. With every fall she seems to be
getting weaker and weaker. My Mother needs assist even with her walker. She needs assistance in the

* bathroom which includes at least two trips during the night. My Mother cari nat get in or out of the
shower alone. She can not regulate the water temperature either. : :

Getting dressed is now nearly impossible to do alone and would be dangerous. She is unable to get her
feet into her pants and she could never put on a palr of socks. Think about how that Is a trip and fall
factor. She gets tangled in her tops and can’t find the arm holes. Buttoning has beeh impossible for
‘some time since her fingers a completely numb.

‘Meals, my mother can’t see, she can’t stand, she is weak and her fingers are numb. She can tg see what is
in the refrigerator and she can not Operator a microwave. She can’t even make coffee and she can’t pour
It as the pot Is too heavy for her. Mary needs assistance to get the food on her fork. Otherwise, it all just
gets pushed around with no accomplishment. If she was left with a package of crackers or a hard candy
she can’t open them. Her fingers are numb. :

Back to the recliner or any chair, She i is too weak to get out of it. | watched, 6,7 attempts. | now have a
belt or bar she can hold onto to pull herup. imagine an emergency if she where to be home alone.

Just a few more points: She can’t operate the telephone, she has no concept of time or date, she can’t
see her medications, she-has had some incontinence, she can’t operate the television. :

Mary needs assistance 24/7. Please, reevaluate her situation. Please spend more than the 20 minutes
with her. My mother may seem pretty sharp in her conversation but she is nearly 93 years old.

Sincerely,

Pamela Connor/Daughter
