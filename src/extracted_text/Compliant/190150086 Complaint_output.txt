Policy Number; 617188
Dear Policyholder:

We are pleased to inform you that Conseco Senior Health Insurance
Company has been renamed to Senior Health Insurance Company of
Pennsylvania (SHIP) and that on November 12, 2008, the Pennsylvania
Insurance Department approved the transfer of SHIP from Conseco, Inc.
affiliates to the Senior Health Care Oversight Trust (Trust).

Instead of being part. of an insurance holding company, SHIP's
operations are being overseen by Trustees whose primary mission and
objective is to ensure that SHIP is run exclusively for the benefit of
its Long Term Care policyholders.

What does this mean for you? In the near future, your billings and
other correspondence will begin to reflect the new name of Senior
Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania. Premium payments paid
electronically through bank drafts will continue as usual, and you
will not be required to make any changes with your bank. The coverage
that you purchased from Conseco Senior Health Insurance Company will
be honored by SHIP. If you are currently receiving benefits under your
policy, your eligible benefits will continue to be paid.

You should read the attached Company Name Change Endorsement and keep
it with your policy. No further action is required on your part. We
appreciate your business and will continue to offer you the good
service you deserve. For your convenience and information, we are
enclosing a "Frequently Asked Questions” list.

Sincerely,

Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania
