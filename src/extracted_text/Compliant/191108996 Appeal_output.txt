{ WARNING: Extemal email, exercise caution! }

Hi
Affer speaking to Amy. I am appealing this decision as I think the communication on the agency part needed some clarifications.
Thave contacted them to clarify and to resend the care plan with clarifications.

My mother currently needs more assistance than the plan can pay so we have family helping her as well as caregiver.

She does need assistance in all bathroom fictions and during her appt. The caregiver is with her at all times as her knees are weak and
legs numbing probably due to diabetic issues.
We try to let her be as dependent as she can but someone is assisting her at most parts of the day.

Best Regards,
Victoria
