RE: JoAnn Sites
Certificate Number: 9424-821064

Dear Sir:

fam writing to ask for your assistance resolving an ongoing issue with regard to CLAIMS
PROCESSED INCORRECTLY against the above referenced certificate, and am also requesting “ra-
servicing” of the account gaing back to dale of service beginning Seplember 26, 2022.

Specifically, the DAILY REMMBURSEMENT AMOUNT IS INCORRECT. IT SHOULD BE $60/DAY:
instead, mast claims have been reimbursed at S40 /cday since mid Ssepiember, 2022. Prior to
that time, claims were processed correctly, | have attached a capy of the certifteale for your
reference, Please note Section 15, Automatic Benefit Increase.

|HAVE CONTACTED CNA MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET THIS CORRECTED since
approximately October, 2022. some clairns hava bean “re-servicad”; however, the underlying
datum causing the problem still has not been updated so it continues to occur. Currently, CNA
owes an additianal S1600+ in corrected clair amounts.

Thank you in advance for your haln.
