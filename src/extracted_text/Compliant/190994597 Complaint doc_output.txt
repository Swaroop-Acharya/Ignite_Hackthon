RE: John E. Bauer
Policy No.: C77291081
File No. MC-W-0040

Dear Sir or Madam:

Asa follow-up to my correspondence of this date, October 15, 2024,
John Bauer shall experience additional care costs. The figure which I set
out in my prior correspondence has changed, as of October 7 or October 8,
of 2024 to $8,261.00. This figure will be the housing and care expenses
which will be ongoing during the life of John Bauer. Additionally, John
Bauer has incurred from January 1, 2024 through October 15, 2024
prescription expenses totaling $2,101.24. The continuing prescription
expense will be based on the requirements set out by the individuals who
are providing assistance to John Bauer at Rittenhouse, John Bauer’s place
of residence.

It is extremely important that CNA respond to the foregoing in an
effort to properly compensate John Bauer for expenses which he has
incurred which shall be paid by CNA though the existing health care policy.
