relatively little material; (e) patient may demonstrate decreased zacility in remembering names upon introduction to
new people; (f} patient may have lost or misplaced an object of value; (g) concentration deficit may be evident on
clinical testing. Objective evidence of memory deficit obtained only with an intensive interview. Decreased
performance in demancing employment and social settings. Denial begins to become manifest in patient. Mild ta
moderate anxiety accompanies symptoms.

Cleer-cut deficit on careful clinical interview. Deficit manifest in following areas: (2) decreased knowledge af current
and recent events; (2) may exhibit some deficit in memary of one’s persanal history; {c) concentration deficit elicited
on serial sudtractions; (d) decreased ability to travel, handle finances, etc. Frequently no deficit in following areas: {3}
orientation to time and place; (b) recognition of familiar persons and faces; (c) ability to travel to familiar locations.
Inability to perform complex tasks. Denial is dominant defense mechanism. Flattening of affect and withdrawal from

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)'*

Make the patient comfortable and establish rapport. Ask questions in the order listed. Total possible score is 30.

Maximum
Score Score
GRIENTATION
5 (D) 1. “Whatis the Gear) (season) (date) (Gay) (ezonth) 2”

§ &) 2." Where are set ages {coupey) (town or city) hospital) (foo).

REGISTRATION

3 (3) Ask the patient if you may test his/her memory. Then say the names of 3 unrelated objects, clearly and
slowly, about one second for each (eg, “apple,” “table,” “penny”). After you have said all 3, ask him/her
to repeat them. This first repetition determmes the score (0-3), but keep saying them until he/she can
repeat all 3, up to 6 trials.

ATTENTION AND CALCULATION a“ BAA
5 ( i) ) Ask the patient to begin with 100 and count backwards by 7. Stop after 5 subtractions (93, 86, 79, 72,
%65). Score the total number of correct answers. If the patient cannot or will not perform the serial 7s
task, ask him/her to spell the werd “WORLD” backwards. The score is the number of letters in the
correct order (eg, DLROW = 5; DLRW = 4; DLORW, DLW = 3, OW = 2; DRLWO = 1).

RECALL Kant 4, &
3 {[} Ask the patient to recall the 3 items repeated above (eg, “apple,” “table,” “penny’).
LANGUAGE

2 (B Naming: Show the patient a wristwatch and ask him/her what it is. Repeat for pencil.
i (1) Repetition: Ask the patient to repeat the phrase “No ifs, ands, or buts” after you.

3 (3)  3-Stage Command: Give the patient a piece of blank paper and ask him/her to “take a piece of paper in
your right hand, fold it in half, put it on the floor.” Score 1 point for each part correctly executed.

1 (\} Reading: On a blank piece of paper, print the sentence “CLOSE YOUR EYES’ in letters large enough
for the patient to see clearly. Ask hirv/her to read it and do what it says. Score ] point only if he/she
actually closes his/her eyes.

1 (|) Writing: Give the patient a blank piece of paper and ask him/her to write a sentence. Do not dictate a
sentence; it is to be written spontaneously. Tt must contain a subject and verb and be sensible. Correct
grammar and punctuation are not necessary.

1 Cf} Copying: Ask the patient to copy the figure of intersecting
pentagons exactly as it is. AN 10 angles must be present and
2 must intersect to form a 4-sided figure to score | point.
Tremor and rotation are ignored.

Maximum Total Suggested guideline for determining the severity of cognitive impamment:
Total Score = Score Mild: MMSE 221
30 CI) Moderate: MMSE 10-20

Severe: MMSE <9
Expected decline in MMSE scores in untreated mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patient is 2 to 4 points per year.”
