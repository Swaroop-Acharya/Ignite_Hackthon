Attention: Long Term Care. Claims Manager

This letter is to appeal the decision that Evalyn R. Householder (Policy 2959302) is required
to have a 90 days of service in the Linden Ponds Continuous Care facility at Linden Ponds
Senior Living Complex priorto receiving any coverage from New York Life Insurance
Company Long Term Care.

An appeal letter regarding Home Support coverage in May 2023.was sent. It provides the
information explalning her needs.and includes data requested. A few of the facts that were
important at that time. April 12, 2023 we received a letter stating that Home Support Care
would expire on May 13,2023, This was our first knowledge of the expiration of the Home
Support Care. We requested a copy of the policy and it stated we had $75,000 of Home
Support Care, That. explained the. expiration of cara. We were told that If she would be
admitted to a nursing home or continuous care unit, NYL-LTC would consider that'a.part of
the policy and she had already been approved for care for a year and then approval would
be considered on an annual baals as it has-been. The appeal was rejected..In our
discussions we raported she needed assistance but was not @ candidate for continuous
care at that time. Her care taam (Primary Gare Doctor, Social Worker, Therapy team and
family ) all agreed that she needed home support but was not a candidate for continuous
care. It was recommended that wa add additional home support:and continue to have her
remain In-our apartment. We did get additional aid and were successful in giving care for a
comfortable life. In-early 2024 the decision was made.to add more home support. in May
we were notified that additional home support from Linden Ponds Home Support was not
available. We researched outside sources and were unsuccessful in obtaining the needed
support. In July we applied for entrance. into Linden Pands Continuous Care. No rooms
were available at that time and we were assigned to the waiting list. On September 4, 2024
we were assigned a roomin Linden Ponds Continuous Care Unit.

Based on the communications in May 2023 and the final billing for Homa. Support Care,
dated June 16, 2023 the policy had a Lifetime Maximum benefit remaining $112,500, we
expected coverage for her admittance on September 4.. On communications with your
agent on September 5-6, she Informed us'we had to have 90 days of'service before we


Oct/28/2024 5:23:22 PM Erickson Living Mgmt 781-534-7179 3/5

qualified for-coverage.. We disagreed with her. Our'contention was Sue was the same
patient, had the same policy, had qualified for additional coverage, was told if she was
admitted to a continuous care unit, had alraady completed a 90 days of service far your
policy and this was a continuation of her coverage. The-agent claimed this was a new claim
and we had to have 90 days of service to qualify. They also needed information from her
Doctor and from Linden Ponds Continuous.. Both units received tha request. We received a
second letter and we checked with the two units. Both stated they had sent the
information, On October 17, we called NYL-LTG.to insure the information was received, We
were. told all Information but one itern was needed before the claim could be approved. In
the conversation the agent stated once they got the information, the claim would be
approved. In our conversation she‘stated there was no:90 day requirement. It had already
been fulfilled and the policy clearly stated that.was not needed. Since | was told first there
was a 90 day period and.now was told it was not required, | questioned her to be sure she
was correct. On October 21, we received another latter raquesting information before they
could process the claim.and added after the claim was approved the 90 service days
starting September 4. | said there is no 90 period based on the October 17 call. She
repeated the $0 days was required. Two say need 90 days, one sald | don’t need it. They
stated they were still waiting on information from Linden Ponds Continuous Care. The
insurance Coordinator was notifled and she said she sant the information raquested and
hightighted the items requested. The Insurance Coordinator at Linden Ponds called NYL-
LTC.and they acknowledged it had been received and was filed in the NYL-LTCG system
incortectly.

| called again to determine if the coverage request had been approved since | had not
received any documents confirming our status, She said the letter was mailed October 17
and should receive it in about 7 days. tasked her when the coverage would begin and she
stated there was no 90 service says. required. Now we have two people saying 90 days
required ant two people saying it was-not required. | requested to talk with the Manager or
Supervisor. Contact was finally made with Isaac, supervisor. He stated there was a 90 days
of services required before the $100 per day inaurance.would begin. | reviewed with him all
the Issues that involved conversations. in May-June 2023, tha four phone calls with 2
different answers (2 said 90 days raquirad —2 said 90 days not raquired, the letters
requesting information (3), the information from Linden Ponds Continuing Care had been
raceived but filed incorrectly in the NYL-LTC.systam, the time-anxiety- other parties time
and efforts to accomplish the many requests, the time to finally approve the claim. Isaac
apologized and | replied the apology was not worth a dime. While| appreciated his apology,
we still did not have any insurance funds.

The issue for filing this appeal Is the difference of opinion whether thls claim was a new
claim or a continuation of Evalyn’s policy after the Home Support portion of the policy was
completed,

1.

Evalyn’s health Issues that required home support have worsened and Continuing
Care.became a necessity, In May 2023, her care team (doctor, social worker,
therapist, and family). agreed it was best for her to have additional home support
versus going to'a nursing home or continuous care facility. We continued to add home
support care.as her condition got more difficult. In May 2024 Linden Ponds Home
Care was unable to fulfill our needs. Outside sources wera researched but wa were
hot successful in obtaining the care needed. In July we applied to Linden Ponds
Continuous Care fot admittance. At that time there were no rooms available, so we
were added to the wait list. September 4 she was admitted and NYL-LTC was notified.
Linden Ponds Senior Living complex has 1300 residents, a medical clinic, therapy
section, and a care unit which consists of three levels of cara. Tha one Sua is located
in is the:long term continuous care section. She moved from our apartment to Linden
Ponds Continuous Care Unit to receive the level of care needad

In May-June 2023 when home support funds were exhausted, we could be covered if
she was admitted to a nursing home or continuous caré facility. At that time we had
$112,500 remaining on her Ufatime benefits.

In May 2023 she was evaluated and her insurance.was approved until May 2024, so
she was qualifisd and her condition worsened so it was only time before we knew the
next step was continuous care

It has:taken from Septernber 4 until October 27 to resolve this. issua.

Conflicting Information from NYL-LTC concerning the. 90 day period has been a major
source in our emotional and financial life. This was a major issue.in trying to
understand what NYL-LTC really was going to do.

Receiving multiple tetters requiring information from two other sources:was excessive
in that the information was sent but filed incorrectly. This required other parties time
and effort to cover NYL-LTC problems.

Thea major issue is whether the 90 days of service Is required or not. We believe-Evalyn
Is the same person who received home support funds and was told if she entered a
nursing home - continuous home her Insurance would continue. Her issues were the
type that would continually worsen but care. at home was best until it could not
provide her the comfort she:needed. Sha was evaluated in May 2023 and approved
for additional time. We believe the 90 period should not apply in this case.


Oct/28/2024 5:23:22 PM Erickson Living Mgmt 781-534-7179 5/5

Add to the. major polnt Is the conflicted information we received over a month and a
half regarding the 90 day period. An additional point is the error in filing which caused
extra phone calls and time required by us and the other parties.

The way this issue has been managed has not been acceptable.

We request that this appeal will receive your thorough review and consider all the
points raised by NYL-LTC failure to provide thorough information and errors, We
request that the 90 service days not be required in this situation.
