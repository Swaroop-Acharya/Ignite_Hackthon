| disagree with TransAmericaâ€™s October 04, 2024 denial of my

Appeal of the above referenced claim, and am appealing the decision based
On the following:

1) The September 20, 2024 face to face visit with a TransAmerica representative
{iHumsin) showed a clear need for assistance with bathing, dressing, ambulation and
Transfers.

2) The Caregiver Plan of Care developed by the home healthcare provider, of which you
Have copies, is clear in the need for assistance with dressing, bathing, mobility and toileting;
Services Caring People has been consistently providing for the past 3+ months.

3) Because of this inability to perform these ADLs independently, the requirements as defined in the
policy are met, and benefits should be approved.

If you disagree with this, | suggest you provide me with the documentation upon which your adverse
decision is predicated, as the information in your correspondence is inconsistent with that provided to
me by your RN representative and by Caring People.
