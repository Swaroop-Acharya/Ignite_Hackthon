Subject: Benefit Eligibility CNA Policy # 076661181

{WARNING: Extemal email, exercise caution! {

Good afternoon,

We received a benefit eligibility determination letter regarding the claim for my mother, Melinda Gail Kist, under CNA Policy
# 076661181.

We disagree with your decision and must appeal. My mother has severe Cognitive Impairment and has been diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease. She needs the services rendered by Senior Lifestyle solutions because she requires supervision to
protect her from threats to her health and safety. Apparently, her neurologist was never contacted by CNA to inquire of
her diagnosis or needs.

Please approve our request or let us know if any additional documentation is required. A completed Claim Form is attached.
Thank you.

Best regards,

--Randy
