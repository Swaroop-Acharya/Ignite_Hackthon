Re: Insured: Carol Shafer
Policy No: 076595017
Underwriting Co: Continental Casualty Company

Dear Ms. Shafer:

We have completed a review of the request from Olivia Duncan for a reconsideration of the
denial of benefits in connection with your residence at Atria Grand Oaks from January 31, 2024
through March 7, 2024.1

The management review of your claim included ail the original documentation contained in your
claim file pertaining to the time period at issue, Ms. Duncan’s correspondence, and a letter she
submitted from Shiron Ruff, Executive Director of Atria Grand Oaks, in support of her position
that you were benefit eligible as of January 31, 2024.

Following careful consideration of all of the available information, the original denial of your |
benefit eligibility prior to March 8, 2024 has been upheld. This decision was made as we have

found no evidence that the claim satisfies the policy coverage provisions and that would prompt

a change in the coverage position set forth in our letter dated June 11, 2024.

Your Long Term Care Policy is federally tax-qualified. Pursuant to the intemal Revenue Code,
ail benefits available under the Policy are conditioned upon being certified by a Licensed Health
Care Practitioner (LHCP) as meeting specific eligibility requirements per the Policy definition of
Chronically lil. The definition of Chronically Ill is taken directly from §7702B of the Internal
Revenue Code, and is mandatory for tax-qualified policies. Further, intemal Revenue Service
Notice 97-31 provides guidance, as well as safe-harbor provisions, regarding the meaning of
certain terms and definitions in tax-qualified policies.

\f certified by a LHCP as being Chronically Ill, as this term is defined by the Policy and the
Internal Revenue Code, “within the 12 months prior to” the period for which benefits have been
claimed, benefits are payable only if Qualified Long Term Care both required and provided
pursuant to a Plan of Care prescribed by a LHCP.

1 Your benefit eligibility was established effective March 8, 2024, as detailed in our letter dated June 11,
2024.

The Policy defines Chronically Ill on page 9 as:

Certified by a Licensed Health Care Practitioner as:

4. being unable fo perform (without substantial assistance from another individual} at least
2 Activities of Daily Living for a period of at least 90 days due to a loss of functional
capacity, or

2. requiring substantial supervision to protect Yourself from threats to health and safety
due to severe Cognitive Impairment.

You will not be considered Chronically {il for any period unless within the 12 months prior
to such period a Licensed Health Care Practitioner has certified that You meet the above
fequirements.

The Policy defines Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) on page 10 as:

The Activities of Daily Living are:

4. Eating. Feeding Yourself by getting food into Your body from a receptacle (such as a plate,
cup or table) or by a feeding tube or intravenously.

2. Dressing. Putting on and taking off all items of clothing and any necessary braces, fasteners,
or artificial limbs,

3. Bathing. Washing Yourself by sponge bath; or in either a tub or shower, including the task of
getting in or out of the tub or shower.

4. Toileting. Getting to and from the toilet, getting on and off the toilet, and performing
associated personal hygiene.

5. Transferring. Moving into or out of a bed, chair, or wheelchair.

6. Continence. The ability to maintain control of bowel and bladder function; or, when unable to
maintain control of bowel or bladder function, the ability to perform associated personal
hygiene, including caring for a catheter or colostomy bag.

Cognitive impairment is defined by the Policy on page 10 as:

A deficiency in Your short- or iong-term memory, orientation as to person, place and time,
deductive or abstract reasoning, or judgment as it relates to safety awareness.

The Policy defines Qualified Long Term Care on page 7 as (emphasis supplied):

Necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, and rehabilitative
services, and Maintenance or Personal Services, which:

4, are required by a Chronically lll individual, and

2. are provided pursuant to a Plan of Care prescribed by a Licensed Health Care
Practitioner.

First, CNA has received no evidence that you required and received substantial assistance to
perform at least two Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) due to a loss of functional capacity prior to
March 8, 2024. There is also no evidence that you were certified by a LHCP as being
Chronically Ill due to the inability to perform at least two ADLs without substantial assistance
within the 12 month period prior to March 8, 2024.

Carol J Shafer
076595017
Page 3

Please note that the Chronically Ill criteria regarding the inability to perform ADLs must be due to
a loss of functional capacity as opposed to a loss of cognitive capacity. As a result, and per IRS
Notice 97-31, the term “substantial assistance” means “hands-on assistance and standby
assistance.” The term “hands-on assistance” means "physical assistance of another person
without which the individual would be unable to perform the ADL." The term "standby
assistance” means "the presence of another person within arm’s reach of the individual that is
necessary to prevent, by physical intervention, injury to the individual while the individual is
performing the ADL.” As such, "supervision," "cueing," "reminders,” “prompting,” “set up" or any
other form of assistance other than standby assistance or hands-on assistance, does not
constitute substantial assistance and cannot be considered a qualifying level of care.

CNA has considered Shiron Ruffs letter dated September 10, 2024 that states you received
“hands on assistance with Bathing and Dressing since 1/31/24." Respectfully, and while we
appreciate Mr. Ruff's desire fo advocate on your behalf, his letter discusses the fact that he was
not employed as Atria's Executive Director on January 31, 2024, or on March 8, 2024 when
Brian Larios updated your functional needs assessment. Furthermore, Mr. Ruff did not disclose
any information regarding, nor provide capies of, the documentation he reviewed in order to
make an informed statement regarding your care needs between January 31, 2024 and March
8, 2024.

Additionally, Mr. Ruff is not a LHCP and is unable to certify you as being Chronically lil. And
even if Mr. Ruff was a LHCP, his letter is dated September 10, 2024. Therefore, it was not
completed “within the 12 months prior to" March 8, 2024, and could not constitute a certification
that you were Chronicaily lll prior to this date. On this same note, we have received no
evidence that Atria provided substantial assistance to you to bathe and dress pursuant to a Plan
of Care prescribed by a LHCP during this period. It is further noted that Atria's invoices confirm
that you were not billed for substantial assistance to perform two or more ADLs until March 8,
2024.

Certainly, Mr. Ruff is encouraged to submit information to us regarding his employment history
at Atria that would substantiate that he has firsthand knowledge of your care needs and the
services you received from facility staff prior to March 8, 2024. He is also encouraged to submit
all documentation in your facilily chart that substantiates his statement that you required and
reveled substantial assistance to bathe and dress pursuant to a Plan of Care prescribed by a
L .

We also have not received any documentation indicating that you have ever been evaluated for,
diagnosed with, or received treatment as a result of a diagnosis of severe Cognitive Impairment
as a result of which you required and received substantial supervision pursuant to a prescribed
Plan of Care in order to protect your health and safety.

We understand that you appealed the benefit eligibility denial either through a review meeting or
a written appeal. A panel consisting of clinical Care Managers and a Medical Director has
reviewed the appeal and determined that the benefit eligibility criteria (‘benefit trigger’) of your
policy was not met prior to March 8, 2024. According to your policy, to qualify for benefits you
must require long term care services because you are Chronically ll. As detailed above, the
documentation submitted in support of your claim contains no evidence that you were certified
by a LHCP as being Chronically lil within the 12 month period prior to March 8, 2024, or that you
required and received Qualified Long Term Care pursuant to a Plan of Care prescribed by a

LHCP because you were Chronically Ill. Since we have determined that the above requirements
have not been met, we are unable to approve your request for benefits prior to March 8, 2024.

If an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making this
adverse benefit determination, a copy of the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or criterion is
available free of charge upon request. Additionally, copies of information relevant to the claim,
including any referenced evidence, documentation or clinical review criteria not previously
provided are also available free of charge upon request.

If you disagree with our decision you may request an independent external review conducted by
long-term care professionals who are not associated with us. The request for an independent
external review must be in writing and received within four months of receipt of this letter,
accompanied by the completed External Review Request Form enclosed. You shouid submit
additional information or material you feel has a bearing on this claim. Please include any
names, addresses and phone numbers of any care providers we should contact who would be
able to provide information in support of your appeal. If you choose an independent external
review, it may be faxed (our preferred method) to 1-952-983-5194. Otherwise, you can mail
your request to the address above.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Olivia Duncan
and I am POA with Family Solutions for Care LLC, for Carol Shafer.

The purpose of this letter is to appeal against the denied dates of service from
1/3 1/24-3/7/24. Please see the attached letter written by Shiron Ruff,
Executive Director with Atria Grand Oaks, clarifying a system issue
regarding Carol Shafer’s documented care dates, I am attaching all plan of
care’s from 2024 as well, confirming this assistance has remained consistent.

Carol has been receiving Hands-On Assistance with Bathing and Dressing
since 1/31/24. There was NOT an assessment completed on 3/8/24, the date
that CNA approved the claim. Carol Shafer’s needs were re-assessed on
1/31/24, as it was then determined she needed hands-on assistance.

Please backdate and approve the claim beginning 1/31/24. After this is done,
the elimination period should reflect met as of 4/30/24, and payment for
5/1/24 thru 6/5/24.

The waiver of premium date effective should then be updated to 2/12/24, and
an additional refund of premiums check for dates 2/12/24-3/20/24 shall be
made.

SENIOR LIVING

Please allaw me to introduce myself. My same is Shiron Ruff, Executive Director al Atria Grand Oaks

lar writing to you to address an error that was made regarding Carol Shafer’s Resident Functional
Needs Assessment, completed on 1/31/24

Carol Shafer has been a resident at Atria Grand Oaks since 7/4/24. On 1/31/24, Mrs. Carol Shafer's care
needs were reassessed. tt was determined that she needed hands-on assistance with both bathing and
dressing, and on that date, the physical assistance began.

In February 2024, a copy of this assessment was requested by Family Sotutions far Care. Brian Larios,
former Executive Director, sent this to Family Schitions for Care, and acknowledged an error was made,
as the Resident Functional Needs Assessment reflected “reminders” instead of Hands-On assistance, The
change was not made in the system timely, as prior to 1/31/24, only reminders were being provided

Due to the way our systems work, when this revisian was made on 3/8/24 to reflect the ACCURATE
assistance provided, the “Assessment Date” notated in the systems changed to the date/time the
assessment was revised and printed, to send. Again, this revision date was on 3/8/24.

Please note. there was NOT an assessment completed on 3/8/24. The fast assessment was completed on
1/31/24.

This letter is to serve as confirmation, further reiterating that Carol Shafer has been receiving hands on
assistance with Bathing and Dressing since 1/31/24

If you have any questions regarding the above, please reach out to me at 480-589 0696

Thank you,

Shiren Ruff, Executive Director
