, including policy values, for the statement period. You should compare these values and the projection of values you received when you
purchased your policy. If the values differ, you may request a projection based on actual history and current value. Call your Servicing Agent or Transamerica if you have any questions
or wish to request an alternate premium payment schedule.

A policy statement is provided annually after the policy anniversary and may be requested between policy anniversaries. Please review this policy statement and future policy
statements carefully. Contact your Servicing Agent or Transamerica with any questions or changes. For more complete definitions and explanations of terms, please refer to your
policy. Please keep all policy statements with your important documents.

+The Net Death Benefit is equal to the current gross death benefit minus any outstanding Loan Balance minus any LTC Rider benefit payments made. The final death benefit would be
further reduced by any amount necessary to provide insurance to the date of the Insured’s death occurring during the grace period. We will adjust the amount of payment in
accordance with any attached Riders or Endorsements, subject to their terms.

If an accelerated death benefit is paid under a Terminal Illness, Chron ness, or Critical Illness Rider, the death benefit will be reduced by the Election Percentage associated with
each claim. The death benefit will be reduced by an amount greater than the accelerated payment. Please refer to those rider forms for more information.

As of the end of the statement period, the cap(s) for new or renewing allocations to the index account(s) are shown below.

Global Index Account DEC 16 2023 13.25% Higher
S&P 500 Index Account DEC 16 2023 12.25% Higher

You should regularly monitor your policy and its values. Interest rates, caps, and policy charges can vary. When caps are lowered, this may result in lower values than were illustrated
previously. Please contact your tax advisor about tax implications of any planned withdrawal, loan, or surrender.

Past performance of an index is not an indication of future index performance. There is no guarantee that any Excess Index Interest will be credited above the guaranteed minimum
interest rate for the Index Account(s). Additionally, there is no guarantee that the company will declare an interest rate greater than the guaranteed minimum interest rate for the Basic
Interest Account.

If no further premiums are received, based on guaranteed assumptions for cost of insurance rates, expense charges, and interest, your policy will have insufficient value to remain in
force on OCT 5 2028.

If no further premiums are received, based on non-guaranteed assumptions for cost of insurance rates, expense charges, and interest, your policy will have insufficient value to remain
in force on JAN 5 2031.

Your Basic Interest Account guaranteed minimum interest rate is 2.00% annually.

Your Index Account(s) guaranteed minimum interest rate is 0.75% annually. Excess index interest is credited on the ending date for the segment. Segments that have not yet reached
a segment ending date have not received any excess index interest and reflect only guaranteed minimum interest.

Withdrawal Fee Eliminated
Good news! We've removed the $25 withdrawal processing fee. Now, you can request a withdrawal from your policy without the fee.

You should not consider replacing your policy, or changing your coverage, without requesting an illustration first. Illustrations are available annually at no cost. Contact your Servicing
Agent or the General Agency listed on page 1, or call customer service at (800) 851-9777. If you do not receive a current illustration of your policy within 30 days of your request, you
should contact your state insurance department.

USES AND DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PHI

1. Treatment. We do not make treatment decisions, but we may
disclose your information to those who do. For example, we
may disclose information regarding your benefits to doctors,
hospitals, long term care facilities, and other health care
providers involved in your care.

2. Payment. We may use and disclose your PHI as necessary for
benefit verification and claims processing purposes. For
instance, we may use information regarding health care
services you receive from service providers such as physicians,
hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes, assisted living facilities,
and home health care agencies to process and pay claims, to
determine whether services are medically necessary or to
otherwise pre-authorize or certify services as covered under
your health plan. We may also forward such information to
another health plan, which may also have an obligation to
process and pay claims on your behalf. Examples of our
payment related purposes also include our collection of
premiums, coordinating reinsurance, and care coordination
activities.

3. Health Care Operations. We will use and disclose your PHI as
necessary, and as permitted by law to operate our business
including performing quality improvement and assurance,

related to your health plan. With the exception of certain long-

your PHI to certain family, friends, and others who are involved
in your care or in the payment for your care based on your
authorization or if we inform you and you do not object. We

your authorization. If you are unavailable, incapacitated,
or facing an emergency medical situation, or if we have
determined, based on our professional judgment and
review of the circumstances, that you would not object
and that a limited disclosure may be in your best interest,
we may share limited PHI without your approval. If you
have designated a person to help prevent the
unintentional lapse of your coverage, we will inform that
person prior to terminating the policy for nonpayment of
premium. We may also disclose limited PHI to a public or
private entity that is authorized to assist in disaster relief
efforts in order for that entity to locate a family member or
other persons that may be involved in some aspect of

disclosures by contacting us at the address shown at the

coverage-related matters and information necessary to
assist in servicing your coverage. For example, your agent
may be notified if we: decline your application, offer you
coverage at a higher than standard rate, or offer to accept
the application with modifications to the benefits you
requested. We may also notify your agent when there is a
change in premium paying status, when we receive notice
of a claim, or notice of the cancellation or replacement of
your policy. Your agent, and, if applicable, the company
the agent represents, may be notified on their commission
